Resnet18_Feature_Extraction_and_k_NN.ipynb:

-> Feature extraction from last fc layer of Resnet18 for Train and Test images in Datasets.

-> Classification using k-Nearest Neighbours.

-> Accuracy Check (k=5) : 95%


Fine_tuning.ipynb:

-> Architecture of ResNet18 was used.

-> last fc layer was customized for our use case.

-> Trained the model on training dataset.

-> Accuracy Check for epochs = 100 : range between [ 97.15, 100 ]
