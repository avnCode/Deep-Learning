# Deep-Learning

## Feature_Extraction_and_Classification.ipynb:

-> Architecture of ResNet18 was cusomized for our use case.

-> Feature extraction from last fc layer of Resnet18 for Train and Test images in Datasets.

-> Classification using k-Nearest Neighbours.

-> Accuracy Check (k=5) : 95%


## Fine_tuning.ipynb:

-> Architecture of ResNet18 was cusomized for our use case.

-> Last fc layer was replaced with new fc layer for the number of classes in our dataset.

-> Trained the model on training dataset.

-> Accuracy Check for epochs = 100 : range between [ 97.15, 100 ]
